# Smart Contract Interface

An interface for interacting with EVM smart contracts.

**Live on:** <https://0xazuredev.github.io/sc-interface/>

## About

This Smart Contract interface is an all-in-one interface for executing smart contract functions without the need for a dedicated frontend. It's simple as A B C, just connect your wallet, paste the contract ABI and address and execute from a list of all the available contract functions.

## How to run locally

You can run the app locally using:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Possible Improvements

- [ ] Add an ETH amount field for payable functions.
- [ ] Remove all `any` references from the app.
- [ ] Better documentation.
- [ ] Add Github logo & link to the app so users can fork.
- [ ] Option to connect wallet with localhost.
- [ ] Save ABI/contract address for easy retrieve and run.
